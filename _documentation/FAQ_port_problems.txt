How to right define ports or what I did wrong and learned how to not do things
==============================================================================
This is from conversation with chatGPT

Q: I tried in palace simulator assign port to cylinder surface but after mesh getting error "Specified direction does not align sufficiently with
bounding box axes" can in FEM method excite port be specified on cylinder or it should be on flat face like rectangle?

A: In finite element method (FEM) solvers like Palace (Parallel Acoustic and Electromagnetic Solver), ports (wave ports) are typically required
to be defined on planar (flat) faces, and not on curved surfaces like the lateral surface of a cylinder.

Error Explanation
-----------------

Error: "Specified direction does not align sufficiently with bounding box axes"
This error generally means:
    - Palace tries to infer a local coordinate system or port orientation for mode solving (e.g., TE, TM).
    - The port face you've chosen is not planar or does not align with standard axes (X, Y, or Z).
    - Palace uses bounding box heuristics to align the mode solver and cannot do this reliably for cylindrical (curved) faces.

Correct Usage of Ports in FEM
    - Ports must be defined on flat, planar surfaces that are perpendicular to the intended excitation direction (e.g., z-directed port uses a face orthogonal to Z-axis).
    - If you have a cylindrical waveguide:
         - Use the flat circular face at the cylinder's end as the port.
         - Do not assign the port to the curved lateral face of the cylinder.

Solution
    - If you want to excite a port on a cylindrical structure:
        1. Identify the flat circular face at the end of the cylinder.
        2. In your mesh or Salome geometry, name or group that circular face.
        3. Assign the wave port in Palace to that planar face, not the side.

Why Planar Surfaces?
Port excitation involves solving an eigenmode problem on the 2D cross-section of the port. This problem requires:
    - A well-defined normal direction (only defined on flat surfaces).
    - An orthogonal mode basis, which is difficult or ill-posed on curved boundaries.
